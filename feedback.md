# Project 1 Evaluation
## Deployment:

### 3: Excelling

Did you successfully deploy your project to github pages? Is the app's functionality the same deployed as it is locally?

## Technical Requirements:

### 3: Excelling

Did you deliver a project that met all the technical requirements? Given what the class has covered so far, did you build something that was reasonably complex?

## Code Quality:

### 2: Performing

Did you follow code style guidance and best practices covered in class, such as spacing, modularity, and semantic naming? Did you comment your code?

## Creativity/Interface:

### 3: Excelling

Is your user interface easy to use and understand? Does it make sense for the problem you're solving? Does your interface demonstrate creative design?

## Notes
Fantastic job on project 1! Your code is very clear and well organized. You can cut down on some code by being more DRY (see inline feedback). You could also improve on consistency in some places by omitting semi-colons and keeping spacing and indentation the same. Your interface looks really great. For next steps there, SASS (http://sass-lang.com/) which is similar to CSS could help make your life easier with the styling. Also I would make the site responsive so that it works on different sized browsers and phones. The code is deployed and definitely fits the technical requirements for 

## Things you want specific feedback on.
### Disc Change Interface
I show in the inline comments how you could make your code work for any number of disks. I would either allow for that, or have a dropdown that asks for three, four, or five disks rather than a text input.

### How to make Cache Clearer
I don't think there is an issue here really. If you wanted it to be more clear, you could have a label at the top of the div that says "currently moving" or something like that.
